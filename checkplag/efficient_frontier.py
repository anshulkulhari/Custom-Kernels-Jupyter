# 
# ### About the author:
# 
# Today's blog post is written in collaboration with [Dr. Thomas Starke](http://drtomstarke.com/). It is based on a longer whitepaper by Thomas Starke on the relationship between Markowitz portfolio optimization and Kelly optimization. The full whitepaper can be found [here](http://eepurl.com/4Pgrv).
# 
# ### Introduction
# In this blog post you will learn about the basic idea behind Markowitz portfolio optimization as well as how to do it in Python. We will then show how you can create a simple backtest that rebalances its portfolio in a Markowitz-optimal way. We hope you enjoy it and get a little more enlightened in the process. 
# 
# We will start by using random data and only later use actual stock data. This will hopefully help you to get a sense of how to use modelling and simulation to improve your understanding of the theoretical concepts. Don‘t forget that the skill of an algo-trader is to put mathematical models into code and this example is great practice.
# 
# Let's start with importing a few modules, which we need later and produce a series of normally distributed returns. `cvxopt` is a convex solver which you can easily download with
# `sudo pip install cvxopt`.
# 
# ### Simulations

# Assume that we have 4 assets, each with a return series of length 1000. We can use `numpy.random.randn` to sample returns from a normal distribution.

# These return series can be used to create a wide range of portfolios, which all
# have different returns and risks (standard deviation). We can produce a wide range
# of random weight vectors and plot those portfolios. As we want all our capital to be invested, this vector will have to some to one.

# In[6]:

def rand_weights(n):
    ''' Produces n random weights that sum to 1 '''
    k = np.random.rand(n)
    return k / sum(k)

print rand_weights(n_assets)
print rand_weights(n_assets)


# Next, lets evaluate how many of these random portfolios would perform. Towards this goal we are calculating the mean returns as well as the volatility (here we are using standard deviation). You can also see that there is
# a filter that only allows to plot portfolios with a standard deviation of < 2 for better illustration.

# In[7]:

def random_portfolio(returns):
    ''' 
    Returns the mean and standard deviation of returns for a random portfolio
    '''

    p = np.asmatrix(np.mean(returns, axis=1))
    w = np.asmatrix(rand_weights(returns.shape[0]))
    C = np.asmatrix(np.cov(returns))
    
    mu = w * p.T
    sigma = np.sqrt(w * C * w.T)
    
    # This recursion reduces outliers to keep plots pretty
    if sigma > 2:
        return random_portfolio(returns)
    return mu, sigma


# In the code you will notice the calculation of the return with:
# 
# $$ R = p^T w $$
# 
# where $R$ is the expected return, $p^T$ is the transpose of the vector for the mean
# returns for each time series and w is the weight vector of the portfolio. $p$ is a Nx1
# column vector, so $p^T$ turns into a 1xN row vector which can be multiplied with the
# Nx1 weight (column) vector w to give a scalar result. This is equivalent to the dot
# product used in the code. Keep in mind that `Python` has a reversed definition of
# rows and columns and the accurate `NumPy` version of the previous equation would
# be `R = w * p.T`
# 
# Next, we calculate the standard deviation with
# 
# $$\sigma = \sqrt{w^T C w}$$
# 
# where $C$ is the covariance matrix of the returns which is a NxN matrix. Please
# note that if we simply calculated the simple standard deviation with the appropriate weighting using `std(array(ret_vec).T*w)` we would get a slightly different
# ’bullet’. This is because the simple standard deviation calculation would not take
# covariances into account. In the covariance matrix, the values of the diagonal
# represent the simple variances of each asset while the off-diagonals are the variances between the assets. By using ordinary `std()` we effectively only regard the
# diagonal and miss the rest. A small but significant difference.
# 
# Lets generate the mean returns and volatility for 500 random portfolios:

# In[8]:

n_portfolios = 500
means, stds = np.column_stack([
    random_portfolio(return_vec) 
    for _ in xrange(n_portfolios)
])


# Upon plotting those you will observe that they form a characteristic parabolic
# shape called the ‘Markowitz bullet‘ with the boundaries being called the ‘efficient
# frontier‘, where we have the lowest variance for a given expected.

plt.xlabel('std')
plt.ylabel('mean')
plt.title('Mean and standard deviation of returns of randomly generated portfolios')
py.iplot_mpl(fig, filename='mean_std', strip_style=True)


# ### Markowitz optimization and the Efficient Frontier
# 
# Once we have a good representation of our portfolios as the blue dots show we can calculate the efficient frontier Markowitz-style. This is done by minimising
# 
# $$ w^T C w$$
# 
# for $w$ on the expected portfolio return $R^T w$ whilst keeping the sum of all the
# weights equal to 1:
# 
# $$ \sum_{i}{w_i} = 1 $$
# Here we parametrically run through $R^T w = \mu$ and find the minimum variance
# for different $\mu$‘s. This can be done with `scipy.optimise.minimize` but we have
# to define quite a complex problem with bounds, constraints and a Lagrange multiplier. Conveniently, the `cvxopt` package, a convex solver, does all of that for us. We used one of their [examples](http://cvxopt.org/examples/) with some modifications as shown below. You will notice that there are some conditioning expressions in the code. They are simply needed to set up the problem. For more information please have a look at the `cvxopt` example.
# 
# The `mus` vector produces a series of expected return values $\mu$ in a non-linear and more appropriate way. We will see later that we don‘t need to calculate a lot of these as they perfectly fit a parabola, which can safely be extrapolated for higher values.

# ### Backtesting on real market data
# This is all very interesting but not very applied. We next demonstrate how you can create a simple algorithm in [`zipline`](http://github.com/quantopian/zipline) -- the open-source backtester that powers [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com) -- to test this optimization on actual historical stock data.
# 
# First, lets load in some historical data using [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com)'s data (if we are running in the [Quantopian Research Platform](http://blog.quantopian.com/quantopian-research-your-backtesting-data-meets-ipython-notebook/), or the `load_bars_from_yahoo()` function from `zipline`.

# In[5]:

from zipline.utils.factory import load_bars_from_yahoo
end = pd.Timestamp.utcnow()
start = end - 2500 * pd.tseries.offsets.BDay()

data = load_bars_from_yahoo(stocks=['IBM', 'GLD', 'XOM', 'AAPL', 
                                    'MSFT', 'TLT', 'SHY'],
                            start=start, end=end)


# In[9]:

data.loc[:, :, 'price'].iplot(filename='prices', yTitle='price in $', world_readable=True, asDates=True)


# Next, we'll create a `zipline` algorithm by defining two functions -- `initialize()` which is called once before the simulation starts, and `handle_data()` which is called for every trading bar. We then instantiate the algorithm object.
# 
# If you are confused about the syntax of `zipline`, check out the [tutorial](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/quantopian/zipline/blob/master/docs/notebooks/tutorial.ipynb).
